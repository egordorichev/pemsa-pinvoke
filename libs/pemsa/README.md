Pemsa is a project, that aims to allow running PICO-8 carts the platforms, that are currently not officially supported, such as Nintendo Switch and Android.
The goal of the project is to emulate the runtime as closely as possible, including full RAM emulation and modified lua with fixed point numbers.

For now this project was not announced, it's in the late stages of development and testing, but the UI for the collection is non existent yet.
Currently we are contacting PICO-8 creators with the goal of releasing this emulator bundled with some iconic carts.
